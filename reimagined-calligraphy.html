Calligraphy has always existed among the comforts of the physical plane. Communication today has a strong presence on a digital platform. This research project investigates the significance of calligraphy as a contemporary method of communication, exploring the translation of calligraphy between physical, digital and virtual environments. It focuses on the notion of typographic <i>authority</i> and the relationship between calligraphy and the typeface in the digital medium. Humans’ evolved ability to communicate complex thought remains a distinguishing feature of our species, one that has accelerated and significantly altered civilisation (Bennett & Jackson, 1980). Visual communication, an extension of the spoken language system, enables us to communicate beyond our limited existence. Calligrapher Donald Jackson notes this instinct to make our mark defines us, describing the alphabet as the “basic currency of our civilisation” allowing us <i>“to communicate through time and distance” </i>(Bennett & Jackson, 1980). The written word has great authority, enabling one to shape the thoughts of others.
<br><br>
Contemporary technologies offer the potential to breathe new life into one of the most ancient of arts. While typeface design is the primary focus of this research project, there will be multiple visual outputs, including explorations into three-dimensional, generative and motion capture calligraphy. This contextual review identifies larger contexts surrounding the research project, identifying the <i>what</i> and addressing the <i>how</i>. It aims to explore the innate qualities of calligraphy, analyse the notion of typographic authority, understand calligraphy’s functionality within type design, establish the contemporary significance of the craft, and identify the potential for calligraphy to translate into a digital medium.
<br><br>

The Line of the Artist 
<br>
Calligraphy is the act of translating meaning into a visual form, however, translation as a notion inevitably involves a loss of meaning: a fragmented copy, though what is lost, retained or enhanced is yet to be addressed. To understand how calligraphy might function in a digital form, one must first establish the characteristics that ought to be translated, and how the digital tools and media might translate those qualities. This section explores the innate qualities of calligraphy and the relationship between the <i>authority</i> of the physical and the digital.
<br><br>
Primarily, calligraphy is a process of line making. Tim Ingold’s <i>Lines: A brief history</i> (2007) is an in-depth theoretical analysis of the line. Ingold notes: “As walking, talking and gesticulating creatures, human beings generate lines wherever they go” (pg. 1). In a section titled <i>Tools of the trade</i>, Ingold discusses the distinctions between the handwritten and the typed. He references Walter J. Ong’s metaphor of the violin and the organ in the context of writing. Ong describes the instruments as tools, allowing the musician to “express something poignantly human that cannot be expressed without the mechanical contrivance” (Ong, 1982, pg. 81-82). Ingold suggests an organ is a machine; a collection of pre-determined sounds, much like the typewriter has pre-determined letterforms (Ingold, 2007, pg. 143). The violin, in this sense, is not a machine. It is unbound. Ingold compares Ong’s metaphor to Russian art theorist Wassily Kandinsky who noted “the pressure of the hand upon the bow corresponds perfectly to the pressure of the hand upon the pencil” (Kandinsky, 1947, pg. 99). Ingold goes on to suggest “Only the pencil, however, leaves a trace”, a visual trace. The line “...bears witness to gestures that, in their qualities of attentiveness and feeling, embody an intentionality intrinsic to the movement of their production.” (Ingold, 2007, pg. 143). Thus the calligraphic line is a visual record of the movements of man.
<br><br>
Based on Ingold’s investigation into the line, one might suggest the act of calligraphy exists within the moment. A piece of calligraphy can, therefore, be a visual memory of the moment; that line never to be redrawn. In contrast, digital methods are somewhat impervious to the decay of time. Technology allows us to record and capture those memories to then replay and analyse - in a sense - to relive the moment. Perhaps this ability to capture time and draw through space can enhance the physical limitations of calligraphy, and in the process, ascertain a new meaning. 
<br><br>
In this research project, I aim to establish how technology, too, can capture and potentially recreate the human movement of calligraphy through the digital stylus, generative type and motion capture. As these technologies are digital, they bring into question the physical quality of calligraphy. Handwriting records more than just human thought. The physical quality or rather “the line of the artist” communicates a presence. German philosopher and cultural theorist Walter Benjamin, who introduced the concept of aura, states:<br><br>

 <i>“Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be... The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity.”  </i>
    (Benjamin, 1969, pg. 3)</p>
<br>
He argues the authentic properties that an original innately contains can never translate into the reproduction. The signature left by the hand tells the story of its making. John Berger’s <i>Ways of Seeing</i> (1977), based on the BBC television series, questions the qualities of the original and the reproduction. “In the age of pictorial reproduction the meaning of paintings is no longer attached to them” (Berger, 1977, pg. 24). He identifies that the ability to reproduce an original destroys the <i>authority</i> of art. As a result, Berger suggests art has become “ephemeral, ubiquitous, unsustainable [sic], available, valueless, free” (pg. 32). In the context of physical and digital calligraphy, physical being the art, the digital being the reproducible form, one could argue the <i>authority</i> of calligraphy is, too, lost. “Art creates; technology can only replicate.” (Ingold, 2007, pg. 127).
<br><br>
It is clear that the value and <i>authority</i> of calligraphy lie within its physical properties. Benjamin and Berger, however, do not speak in the context of the contemporary state of technology. Though digital calligraphy is not physical, it remains a record of human movement, as the hand continues to control the digital pen. Motion capture and the digital stylus are able to track and translate movement into code. One may suggest a paradox exists. Digital calligraphy would therefore sit between the original and the reproduction, as it is instantly reproducible. 

<br><br>

Authority of the Word
  <br> 
Authority, in relation to typography, is a relatively unexplored concept. What gives one’s perception of ‘truth’ the authority over another? Does the power lie in the meaning of the words, or rather in the manner in which they are recorded? Perhaps the notion of authority is far more complex than the manner in which they are written. Words are powerful means of persuasion. Entire lives can be devoted to the words written within a single book. 
<br><br>
In David R. Olson’s <i>On the Language and Authority of Textbooks</i> (1980), he suggests, “Written texts, among other things, are devices which separate speech from speaker, and that separation in itself may make the words impersonal, objective, and above criticism” (Olson, 1980, pg. 192). Olson makes reference to an essay by French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in which he suggested his distrust of script 
<sup>1</sup>, as knowing the originator, facilitates criticism of <i>authority</i>. Olson goes on to state:
<br><br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
<i>“writing and especially print removed the accent and signature of the speaker from his utterance which therefore took on a spurious life and authority of its own… This divorce… is a source of authority of the written word” </i>(Olson, 1980, pg. 194).</p>
 <br>
He is suggesting this separation from the spoken word when the information is written, gives it the authority, as one cannot criticise that which one cannot identify. This notion is exacerbated by the further separation between the written and the printed. The identifying nature of the handwritten word falls short in the quest for authority. 
Calligraphy is malleable, crafted by the hand; an unreproducible mark. It bears witness to the signature of the hand that crafted it. And to rewrite the same words, in the same manner where mistakes may occur, means the meaning could be lost. Calligraphy is liquid. Perhaps the <i>authority</i> of calligraphy in comparison to the <i>authority</i> of the typeface lies within the very nature of its production. The typeface is solid. Typefaces allow one to create the same body of text with complete accuracy. Its form is anonymous. The typeface is static, made by machine; a reproducible mark stamped into existence.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it is evident that not all typefaces subjectively project an authoritative tone. A study conducted by Errol Morris concluded that Baskerville (fig. 1) was the most trustworthy, out of a small selection of frequently used typefaces, including Helvetica (Morris, 2012). Statements written in Baskerville had the greatest authority. Baskerville<sup>2</sup> is a serif typeface with remnants of the calligraphic. Perhaps it is not the total anonymity as seen in many sans-serifs that makes a typeface trustworthy, but rather that a slight sense of the handcrafted can project <i>authenticity</i>, provided there is enough separation from the line of the artist.

<br><br>


Calligraphic Functionality In Type
<br>
As typeface design is one of the primary visual outputs of this research project, this contextual review also addresses the significance of calligraphy in typeface design.  This section aims to establish how an authority is projected through the concept of anonymity and to gain an understanding of the purpose of the calligraphic line within type design, finding the balance of form and functionality.
<br><br>
During the modernist movement, as Design was attempting to define itself, the line or visual presence of the designer came into question. Perhaps one of the most influential writings questioning the function of the typeface is Beatrice Warde’s essay titled <i>The Crystal Goblet</i> (1932). In it, Warde likens design to a transparent glass as an object for containing wine; wine being a metaphor for content. Warde states that a heavily decorated glass conceals the wine. A crystal clear glass, however, would “reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain” (pg. 1). Warde is arguing for anonymity within the graphic design practice, so as not to distort the translation of information. She suggests type’s purpose is to transmit meaning with total anonymity: “type well used is invisible as type” (Warde, 1932, pg. 2). This concept supports Olson’s theory of the <i>authority</i> of the anonymous.
<br><br>
Indeed, many designers have attempted to define the ultimate approach to type design, some notably more dogmatic than others. Two sides dominate the discussion. One sees type as a system determined and constructed by universal laws, the other as a rhythmical human approach, an expression of human movement. Kinross noted that “This conflict was the ancient one of the rationally correct against the aesthetically satisfying (Kinross, 2004, pg. 165). Spawned out of modernism, Jan Tschichold was perhaps one of the most prolific advocates for adopting systems based on geometry within Design. In <i>The New Typography</i>, originally published in 1928, he states:<br><br>
 <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">  

<i>  “Individualistic work, the “line” of the artist, are the exact opposite of what we are trying to achieve. Only anonymity in the elements we use and the application of laws transcending self combined with the giving up of personal vanity (up till now falsely called “personality”) in favour of pure design...”</i> (Tschichold, 1995, p. 28-29).
</p><br>
Tschichold is arguing for the removal of the line made by man, flawed and ephemeral, replaced with “pure design,” prescribing Paul Renner’s Futura, envisioning it as the future of typeface design (pg. 74). Though Futura<sup>3</sup> is considered a classic amongst typefaces, the original form (fig. 2) was far from legible. Ellen Lupton (1993) notes the original ‘g’ translates a “conventional letterform into a geometric language” (pg. 41). Though the line of man is no longer present, it is unrecognisable as a Roman letter. Like Futura, Herbert Bayer’s Universal typeface (fig. 3-4) was an attempt to simplify the language system and bring anonymity. Robin Kinross, in the introduction of <i>The New Typography</i>, remarked Bayer’s “work showed little of the calligraphically trained and historically informed typographer’s sensitivity to letterforms or to the handling of text” (Tschichold, 1995, pg. xlii). Typeface design requires a basic understanding of the history of visual communication, the typeface being the evolved form of calligraphy (fig. 5-7). Emil Ruder suggests “handwriting can be seen to underlie any good typeface” (Ruder, 1977, pg. 186). Frederic W. Goudy (1918) too, argues that “...they are classics, and should not be tampered with, except within limits that just discretion may allow” (pg. 9). 
<br><br>
Collectively, Ruder, Kinross and Goudy firmly establish the significance of calligraphy in typeface design, all acknowledging that typefaces should be approached calligraphically. In contrast, Warde and Tschichold suggest a typeface should remain anonymous to project authority, implying this cannot be achieved through calligraphic forms. Type design is an aspect of graphic design extensively theorised through history. From this review, it seems generally acknowledged that functionality is the ultimate objective of a typeface, though achieving that appears to be subjective. The line of man is both essential and detrimental within type design. In my process of developing a calligraphic typeface for this research project, I will consider the balance of the line and the function. 
<br><br>


Digital Translation
<br>
Calligraphy is a practice with a long, rich history, though its significance in contemporary society is somewhat neglected and many regard it as a traditional, obsolete practice. In this final section, I aim to establish the significance of the craft and identify the potential for calligraphy to translate into a digital medium. 
<br><br>
Master Penman Jake Weidmann, in a presentation titled <i>Why Write? </i>(2014), discusses the power of the written word and the relevance of calligraphy in the 21st century. Weidmann argues the decline of handwriting in the school system is a concerning problem: “We declare its value on what we teach or do not teach our children.” Acknowledging the significance of digital natives learning to type, Weidmann argues this must not come at the expense of handwriting: “One thing we need to stop doing is putting handwriting and technology in opposing corners.” Referencing a study in which the cognitive ability of children is revealed to be enhanced when writing compared to typing, he strongly argues we must listen to what the science and technology are telling us (Weidmann, 2015). A great quantity of research has been carried out in this field. In a journal article published in <i>Computer & Education</i> (2016), Wollscheid, Sjaastad & Tømte collated and reviewed multiple studies contrasting the significance of handwriting and typing in early education. These neuroscientific studies reveal that the act of drawing the letterform activates certain regions of the brain not active when typing. These regions are known to underline the development of reading abilities. Longcamp (2005) notes “that writing movements - writing seen as a spatial process - appear to contribute to memorising the shape of single letters” (Longcamp et al, 2005, as cited in Wollscheid, Sjaastad & Tømte, 2016, pg. 21). Typing involves an entirely different process, comprised of pre-determined forms lacking graphomotor skills required to understand form (pg. 21). 
<br><br>
Weidmann, while highlighting the significance of calligraphy in early education and acknowledging the need for integration, fails to address the how. Weidmann’s talk firmly positions the need to research the translation of calligraphy into the digital medium. And though multiple studies address the issue, there is a void in research linking the two together. My research project aims to address the how. It is important to note that designers have been exploring the dynamics of the screen since its advent. Matthew Hiller’s <i>Virtual Typography</i> (2009) is a detailed collection of how ‘type’, a static form originating from print, has been translated into a digital medium. Hiller notes “virtual typography is time-based. Thus, it operates on the borderline between image and text” (Hiller, 2009, pg. 9). Though it documents numerous designers experimenting with type through time and 3D space on the screen, there is a great deal unknown of the potential within calligraphy and specifically the <i>authority</i> of the written word when translated into a digital context. 
<br><br>



Conclusion 
<br>
Calligraphy is a poetical, eloquent practice that, in my opinion, remains too complacent in its traditions. The translation of calligraphy into a digital medium is essential as “...we may soon find we’ve created the most technically advanced way of creating illiteracy” (Weidmann, 2014). Through this contextual review, I have established the significance of calligraphy and the need for integration between physical and digital mediums, identifying how calligraphy might translate into a digital form through different methods. I have opened up a whole new area of research relating to digital calligraphy and the relationship to the <i>authority</i> of the written word. Digital calligraphy might bring an <i>authority</i> to the handwritten word.
<br><br>
Calligraphy was once the dominant mode of written communication, rendered obsolete by the reproducible machine and typeface. Type design is a system, and with systems inevitably come constraints, the typeface being the constrained version of calligraphy. We are no longer constrained by the printing structure. We now have the technologies capable of recording and displaying the line of human movement at our disposal. It is therefore justified to suggest the screen once again liberates calligraphy.
